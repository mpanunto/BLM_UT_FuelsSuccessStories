Tooele County was awarded $150,000 by BLM Utah to conduct vegetation management activities to reduce the intensity of wildfire and contribute to a more fire-resilient landscapes. These activities will include roadside and field mowing, thinning and limbing trees, transporting fire-risk fuels away from the community to the landfill, and implement prescribed burning on private lands. Additionally, there will be a public education component which will comprise of teaching the public about established vegetation management techniques, helping them understand wildfire risk mitigation, and creating sample plots where people can observe optimal fire-resilient landscapes. Throughout the funding cycle, Tooele County will conduct follow-up inspection on each of the hazardous fuel&rsquo;s reduction projects and CWPP recommendations to determine the progress and effectiveness of mitigation strategies and will implement modifications as necessary.</p>
